        This video essay was created for my Narrative course, in which we were supposed
        to create a presentation analyzing some narrative structure or topic of our
        choice. Being interested in narrative across mediums, and being a huge fan of
        the stories of the Walking Dead comic and videogame world, I decided to analyze
        how I feel The Walking Dead was able to successfully translate its original form
        to both the television and videogame formats.
