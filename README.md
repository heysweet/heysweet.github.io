# heysweet.github.io

This website is a portfolio and blog site that I built using React, TypeScript, NextJS, and Tailwind CSS.
It is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
The site is designed to be easy to maintain and update, with a focus on performance and accessibility,
and meant to showcase my work and projects.
